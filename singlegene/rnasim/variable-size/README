# begin by running 


prerequisites:
	-Linux, bash, and anaconda (miniconda).

how to execute:
Execute the commands below with the given order. A brief explanation
of each command is given below itself.

------------------------
`scripts/gen-replicates.sh`

This will generate replicates (backbone and query alignments). This procedure 
will select 200 query sequences in 5 replicates and subsample an alignment
with 200,000 sequences down to 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, and 100000.

-------------------------
`scripts/prep_jobs.sh`

This will create a list of jobs. Each line is a job that infers a backbone tree 
using FastTree and creates reference packages for apples-2 and pplacer. To run
jobs locally (instead of distributing to a HPC, you can run 
`scripts/prep_jobs.sh | bash`

-------------------------
`scripts/place_jobs.sh`

This will create a list oj jobs. Each line is a job that perform placements on
a dataset with a certaion backbone size and certain replicate number using 
one of the following softwares: apples-2, apples, pplacer, epa-ng. The job will
report running time as well as delta error for each query placement. The measurement
will be written to data/<size>/<replicate no>/<toolname>/result.csv
