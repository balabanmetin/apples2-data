# begin by running 

prerequisites:
	-Linux, bash, and anaconda (miniconda).

how to execute:
Execute the commands below with the given order. A brief explanation
of each command is given below itself.

------------------------
`scripts/gen-replicates.sh`

This will create the conda environment, download and install required software, generate replicates (in this case, there is only one replicate). 

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have not run "assembly" workflow and have not download the backbone alignments , go ahead and download backbone alignments using the following link:
https://doi.org/doi:10.6076/D1M59N

Make sure that after extracting the archive, "alignments" directory is located  under same directory as this readme file.

If you already completed this step before, alignments directory should be already linked to the downloaded dataset.

-------------------------
`scripts/align.sh`

This will create a list of jobs. Each line is a job that aligns query 
marker genes onto backbone alignment using UPP. There is 381 marker genes. 
To run jobs locally (instead of distributing to a HPC, you can run 
`scripts/align.sh | bash`

-------------------------
`scripts/place_jobs.sh`

This will create a list of jobs. Each line is a job that perform placements on
a dataset with a certain number of marker genes (only 381) using apples-2. The job will
report running time as well as delta error for each query placement. The measurement
will be written to data/<size>/result.csv
Again, this can be locally run: `scripts/place_jobs.sh | bash`

-------------------------
`scripts/collect_results.sh`

This scripts will create a csv file called `results.csv` which reports the placement error for each query. In `results.csv` file, the fields are error, query genome, scaffold id, number of marker genes (marker gene occupancy) in eqch query, number of marker genes in the backbone, and the datatype (scaffold).
