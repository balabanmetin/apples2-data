# begin by running

prerequisites:
        -Linux, bash, and anaconda (miniconda).

how to execute:
Execute the commands below with the given order. A brief explanation
of each command is given below itself.

------------------------
`scripts/create_backbone_alignment.sh`

This will create concatenated backbone alignments

(This is the first step!) You also need to download backbone alignments per gene using the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Nmt5_0CidSWOGrqxFlC_cqOArRI3o07/view?usp=sharing

Make sure that after extracting the archive, "alignments" directory is located  under same directory as this readme file.

------------------------
`scripts/generate_replicates.sh`

This will generate replicates (in this case, there is only one replicate).

-------------------------
`scripts/place_jobs.sh`

This will create a list of jobs. Each line is a job that perform placements on
a dataset with (10, 25, 50, 381)  marker genes using apples-2. The job will
report running time as well as delta error for each query placement. The measurement
will be written to data/<size>/result.csv
Again, this can be locally run: `scripts/place_jobs.sh | bash`

-------------------------
`scripts/collect_results.sh`

This scripts will create two csv files called `best_random_accuracy.csv` which reports the placement error for each query and `best_random_time_memory.csv` which reports running time and memory usage of each run. In `best_random_accuracy.csv` file, the fields are error, query genome, marker gene strategy, and number of marker genes in the backbone. In `best_random_time_memory.csv` the fields are time, memory, marker gene strategy, number of marker genes, and number of sites in the concatenated backbone.
